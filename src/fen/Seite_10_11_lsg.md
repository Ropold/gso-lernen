**Supplier:** Fashion Supplies Ltd., Mike speaking. How can I help you?

**You:** Hello Mike, this is [Your Name] from [Your Company] in [City], Germany. I'm calling about our order for 'Dandy' suits.

**Supplier:** Hi [Your Name]. Can you give me the order number and date?

**You:** Yes, it's order number DS/247/20__ dated 15th January.

**Supplier:** Let me just pull that up. Yes, I've got it here. Is there a problem?

**You:** I'm afraid there is. We received the delivery yesterday, but there's a problem with the colours. We ordered 5 suits in each size in blue and 5 suits in each size in anthracite. However, we received 5 suits in each size in brown instead of blue. The anthracite suits are correct.

**Supplier:** Oh dear, I'm very sorry about that. Let me check what happened.

**You:** The problem is that we specifically need the blue suits for our spring collection, and brown doesn't fit our range at all.

**Supplier:** I completely understand. I can see from our system that we mixed up your order with another customer's order. I sincerely apologize for this mistake.

**You:** Do you think it would be possible to send us the correct blue suits as soon as possible? We need them by the end of next week at the latest.

**Supplier:** Absolutely. I'll arrange for the immediate dispatch of the blue suits. We have them in stock, so they can be sent out tomorrow by express delivery. What would you like us to do with the brown suits?

**You:** Could you arrange to have them collected from our warehouse?

**Supplier:** Of course. I'll send you a return label via email today, and our courier will pick them up within the next two days.

**You:** That sounds good. I'd appreciate it if you could confirm all of this in writing.

**Supplier:** I'll send you a confirmation email within the hour. Once again, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. This won't happen again.

**You:** Thank you for dealing with this so quickly, Mike. I look forward to receiving the correct items.

**Supplier:** Thank you for your patience. Goodbye, [Your Name].

**You:** Goodbye, Mike.

**From:** [your.name]@[yourcompany].de
**To:** orders@fashionsupplies.co.uk
**Sent:** 20__-02-15
**Subject:** Incorrect colour delivery - 'Dandy' suits, Order No. DS/247/20__ of 15 Jan 20__

Dear Sir or Madam

I am writing with reference to our order No. DS/247/20__ for 'Dandy' men's suits dated 15 January 20__.

The consignment arrived yesterday. However, when our Incoming Goods Control checked the merchandise, we found that you have sent us the wrong colour.

**Our order:**
- 5 suits 'Dandy' in each size (38-52) in **blue**
- 5 suits 'Dandy' in each size (38-52) in anthracite

**What we received:**
- 5 suits 'Dandy' in each size (38-52) in **brown** (instead of blue)
- 5 suits 'Dandy' in each size (38-52) in anthracite (correct)

The problem is that we specifically need the blue suits for our spring collection. Brown does not fit our product range at all, and therefore we cannot use these items.

We believe that our order was apparently mixed up with another customer's order.

We would ask you to:
- Arrange for the immediate dispatch of the correct blue suits (5 in each size 38-52)
- Have the incorrect brown suits collected from our warehouse at your expense
- Ensure that the correct blue suits reach us by 25 February 20__ at the latest

We expect that you will settle this matter speedily and to our entire satisfaction. Please confirm the replacement delivery and collection arrangements as soon as possible.

We trust that this was an isolated incident and look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Company]
