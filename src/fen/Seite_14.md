Dear Ms Brookfield

Thank you for your e-mail drawing a serious problem to our attention.

We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the incorrect labelling of the polo shirts and thank you for suggesting a solution. We perfectly agree with you that it would be best to ask a firm in Britain to replace the tags. New tags have already been dispatched to your address by air. It goes without saying that we are prepared to bear the costs for the re-labelling of the polo shirts.

Meanwhile we have started investigations into how this mistake could have happened and promise to improve our quality-control procedures.

To make up for the inconvenience caused, we would like to offer you a price reduction of 10% on your next order.

We look forward to hearing from you again.

Best regards

#### Complaints - Dealing with complaints

1. Although you promised delivery within a week, our order has not yet arrived. Could you please look into this matter?

   a. 300 jars of tomato relish have already been handed over to our forwarders for transportation to Germany. We are very sorry for this oversight. It seems that the person processing your order must have mistaken the handwritten 7 on the telephone memo for a 4.

2. On 18 January we ordered 700 jars of tomato relish by phone but were sent us only 400 jars. Would you please arrange for the missing 300 to be shipped to us immediately?

   b. We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened. Nevertheless, we will be sending you replacements for the damaged goods first thing tomorrow morning. A thorough investigation into our quality-control procedures has already been initiated.

3. When we signed the contract for the building of the conservatory you promised that the work would be completed in four weeks. That was 2 months ago and the work is still only half finished.

   c. Please accept our apologies for the delay. Your order was dispatched the day before yesterday and should reach you in the next few days. We apologize once more for the delay that was due to the introduction of new software in our dispatch department.

4. The packaging of the DVDs appeared to be in perfect condition. On unpacking the DVDs, however, we discovered a number of scratches. A list of the damaged DVDs is enclosed.

   d. I would like to apologize for the delay for which we are, however, not completely to blame. When the work was in progress you asked for a number of alterations that held up work. For example, there was an additional delivery time for the Italian tiles you insisted on instead of the British ones provided for in our offer.
