#### Briefing

Similar to German, you can begin an enquiry by telling the addressee where you obtained their address or why you are contacting them (e.g. internet, catalogue, business partner, Chamber of Commerce), or what the enquiry relates to (quotation, advertisement).

It is advisable to then introduce your own company so that the addressee knows who they are dealing with (the size of your company could also have an impact on the price of a product).

Now you need to get to the point; you state specifically what you would like to have, what you are interested in. If you want to find out more, this is the place to do so. The usual closing phrases that you are familiar with from business letters, faxes or e-mails round off your enquiry.

For enquiries concerning really large orders, the traditional business letter is preferred, otherwise fax or e-mail is the medium of choice.

#### Intercultural Communication

Whether you are writing an enquiry about a product or just want some information, remain polite; *polite and direct and must are situations to avoid:* instead use *"We would like to know if...", "We should have your offer by the end of the week"* or *"Could you please help us with some information?"*

In American English, *enquiry* is written as *inquiry*.
